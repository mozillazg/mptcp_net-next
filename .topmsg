Subject: [PATCH] DO-NOT-MERGE: mptcp: use kmalloc on kasan build (net)

(only for -net)

Helps detection UaF, which apparently kasan misses
with kmem_cache allocator.

We also need to always set the SOCK_RCU_FREE flag, to
preserved the current code leveraging SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU.
This latter change will make unreachable some existing
errors path, but I don't see other options.
