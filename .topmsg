Subject: [PATCH] DO-NOT-MERGE: mptcp: improve code coverage for CI (net)

(only for -net)

mptcp: use kmalloc on kasan build

  Helps detection UaF, which apparently kasan misses with kmem_cache
  allocator.

  We also need to always set the SOCK_RCU_FREE flag, to preserved the
  current code leveraging SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU. This latter change will
  make unreachable some existing errors path, but I don't see other
  options.

tcp: warn if tcp_done() is called on a closed socket

  This is an extra check mainly for the CIs: to make sure we don't call
  tcp_done() on an already closed socket as it happened in the past. If
  we do such call, better to catch the error earlier.
